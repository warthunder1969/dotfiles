## Default Prerequisites

System setup and configs for my Linux (and potentially other) systems. I have a few hanging around but I try to leave their configs here as I can. **Where they will work I can't say but I'm sure alot of my scripts will work just fine on other Ubuntu/Debian platforms. I only test what I run so....** I can say if you've got the following most stuff should work:
- git
- wget
- curl

Compatability I only garuntee compatability with "Works on My Machine TM" but the TLDR of that is:

 - Linux Mint                  
 - Linux Mint [Debian Edition]  
 - Debian [Stable]             

those platforms shoudl give you a nice time. I primarily work with apt and flaptak so take that for what you will.
## Installation
1. Clone this Repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/warthunder1969/dotfiles.git`
2. cd into the cloned directory:
   `cd dotfiles`
3. Now paroose and do with the files as you please. The directory structure is as follows:
   - `config`  - any non-specific configuration files
   - `scripts` - any scripts that I have written that I plan to use. I will eventually include any setup scripts I use on a non-public git repo here once they are of "good" quality or have been tested well enough before they hit here
    - `pkgs`  - You'll likely never see this, unless I plan to upload tarballs or deb for packages I can't get in a repo. This will likely be empty or nonexistant publically.
   - `themes` - any appearance related items that I might need or use. This will include fonts, themes, icons etc. I'm not much for ricing one's computer but it'll be here. I'm a very simple man: Dark Theme + a nice accent color. 

## Support
Good Luck :) Provided as-is no warranty. That being said most of the code here "should work" just take that statement with a grain of salt.

## Roadmap
This will change / evolve over time as I find better ways of doing things. I don't know that I will specific releases just this codebase will evolve as I need it to

## Contributing
Not really doing contributions on this project but if you have suggestions feel free. I will have other projects that I will be taking suggestions for.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Working on that

## License

TLDR Do what you want with my code here, just let others know where you got it from if you would be so kind.

## Project status
Personal / hobby time. I won't commit to regular work on this but as my needs change so will the software I use.
