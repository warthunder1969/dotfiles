## Default Prerequisites

System setup and configs for my linux systems. I have a few hanging around but I try to leave their configs here as I can. **Where they will work I can't say but I'm sure alot of my scripts will work just fine on other Ubuntu/Debian platforms. I only test the following**

Compatability from my testing I've seen that my scripts currently work on the following desktops though I only garuntee compatability with Mint:

| Distribution                | Version    
| ----------------------------| -------- | 
| Linux Mint                  | 22       | 
| Linux Mint [Debian Edition] | 6        | 
| Debian [Stable]             | 12       | 

## Installation
1. Clone this Repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/warthunder1969/dotfiles.git`
2. cd into the cloned directory:
   `cd dotfiles`
3. Now paroose and do with the files as you please. The directory structure is as follows:
   - `config`  - any non-specific configuration files
   - `scripts` - any scripts that I have written that I plan to use. I will eventually include any setup scripts I use on a non-public git repo here once they are of "good" quality or have been tested well enough
   - `themes` - any appearance related items that I might need or use. 

## Support
